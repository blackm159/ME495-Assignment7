## **Information**
#### 
- The goal of this assignment is to grow a creature with randomized links.
- Links are grown from a "torso" link on each side face.  Each leg can have 0 to 4 links, growing either downward or outward to the side.  Between 1 and 5 "torsos" are created.
- Joints are centered on the face of attachment.  Each joint has a randomized axis of rotation.  Each joint is motorized.
- A random number of links between 3 and the total number of links are sensorized.  These links are represented with green.  Links without sensors are blue.
- This figure shows how links and joints are grown to create a given creature:
